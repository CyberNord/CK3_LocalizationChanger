# CK3_LocalizationChanger

It annoyed me to change the localization manually every time a mod didn't have it.
This allows you to quickly edit the file name and content. 


eg: 
filename: 
"historicinvasions_wars_l_english.yml" ---> "historicinvasions_wars_l_german.yml"
content: 
"l_english:  //whatever" ---> "l_german:  //whatever"
